# MatLLMSearch

LLM-based Crystal Structure Generation and Optimization for Materials Discovery, integrated with the SDE-Harness framework.

## Overview

MatLLMSearch leverages large language models to generate novel crystal structures and optimize them for materials properties. This implementation is integrated with the SDE-Harness framework to provide a standardized workflow for scientific discovery.

## Features

- **Crystal Structure Generation (CSG)**: Generate novel crystal structures using evolutionary algorithms guided by LLMs
- **Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP)**: Predict ground state structures for target compounds  
- **Multi-objective optimization**: Optimize for stability (E_hull distance) and mechanical properties (bulk modulus)
- **Multiple LLM support**: Local models, OpenAI GPT, and DeepSeek
- **Structure validation**: Automated validation of generated structures
- **Comprehensive analysis**: Built-in analysis tools for experimental results

## Quick Start

### Crystal Structure Generation (CSG)
Generate novel crystal structures using evolutionary optimization:

```bash
python cli.py csg \
    --model meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct \
    --population-size 100 \
    --max-iter 10 \
    --opt-goal e_hull_distance \
    --data-path data/band_gap_processed_5000.csv \
    --save-label csg_experiment
```

### Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP)
Predict ground state structures for a target compound:

```bash
python cli.py csp \
    --compound Ag6O2 \
    --model meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct \
    --population-size 10 \
    --max-iter 5 \
    --save-label ag6o2_prediction
```

### Analysis
The `analyze` command evaluates generated structures and computes comprehensive metrics including:
- Structural validity and composition validity
- Structural diversity and composition diversity
- Structural novelty and composition novelty (vs reference pool)
- Overall novelty (fraction of structures that are both compositionally and structurally novel)
- M3GNet metastability
- Stability rates (CHGNet)

#### Evaluate Existing Results

**Option 1: From a CSV file**
```bash
python cli.py analyze \
    --input data/llama_test.csv \
    --output evaluation_results.json \
    --data-path data/band_gap_processed_5000.csv
```

**Option 2: From a previous CSG run directory**
```bash
python cli.py analyze \
    --results-path logs/analyze_generation \
    --output reevaluated_results.json \
    --data-path data/band_gap_processed_5000.csv
```
This will look for `generations.csv` in the specified results path.

#### Generate and Evaluate via API

Generate structures using the CSG evolutionary workflow with API models and then evaluate:

```bash
python cli.py analyze --generate \
    --model openai/gpt-5-mini \
    --data-path data/band_gap_processed_5000.csv \
    --max-iter 10 \
    --population-size 10 \
    --reproduction-size 5 \
    --parent-size 2 \
    --output gpt5_results.json
```

**Key parameters for API generation:**
- `--generate`: Flag to enable API generation (uses CSG workflow)
- `--model`: Model to use (e.g., `openai/gpt-5-mini`, `openai/gpt-4o-mini`)
- `--data-path`: Path to seed structures CSV (used as reference pool for novelty)
- `--max-iter`: Number of evolutionary iterations
- `--population-size`: Initial population size
- `--reproduction-size`: Number of offspring per generation
- `--parent-size`: Number of parent structures per group

**Note:** All generated structures are kept and deduplicated after all iterations complete before evaluation.

#### Finding Results from Previous Runs

When you run `analyze --generate`, the CSG workflow saves intermediate results to:
- `logs/analyze_generation/generations.csv`: All generated structures with properties
- `logs/analyze_generation/metrics.csv`: Per-iteration metrics

The final evaluation summary is saved to the `--output` file you specify (e.g., `gpt5_results.json`).

To re-evaluate a previous run:
```bash
python cli.py analyze \
    --results-path logs/analyze_generation \
    --output new_evaluation.json \
    --data-path data/band_gap_processed_5000.csv
```

## Configuration Options

### Models
MatLLMSearch now uses SDE-Harness unified model interface with support for:
- **Local models**: Llama, Mistral, and other Hugging Face models
- **OpenAI**: GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-3.5-turbo

Model configuration is handled via the main SDE-Harness `config/models.yaml` and `config/credentials.yaml` files.

### Optimization Goals
- `e_hull_distance`: Minimize energy above convex hull (stability)
- `bulk_modulus_relaxed`: Maximize bulk modulus (mechanical properties)
- `multi-obj`: Multi-objective optimization combining both

### Structure Formats
- `poscar`: VASP POSCAR format
- `cif`: Crystallographic Information File format

## Architecture

MatLLMSearch is **fully integrated** with SDE-Harness core components:

### **Materials-Specific Components**
- **StructureGenerator**: Uses Generation class for LLM-based structure creation
- **MaterialsOracle**: Evaluates structures using CHGNet/ORB for stability and properties
- **StabilityCalculator**: DFT surrogate models for energy and mechanical property prediction

## Evaluation Measurements

Crystal structure discovery. Each experiment began with an initial population of $100$ groups of parents ($100 \times 2 = 200$ parent structures), seeded from the MatBench-bandgap dataset selected with lowest deformation energy by CHGNet. The mutation and crossover operations for LLMs were implemented by prompting the LLMs with two sampled parent structures based on their fitness values (minimizing $E_\text{d}$) and querying them to propose $5$ new structures either through mutation of one structure or crossover of both structures. After generating new offspring in each generation, we evaluated the new offspring and merged their evaluations with the parent evaluations from the previous iteration. The merged pool of parents and children were then ranked by their fitness values (minimizing $E_\text{d}$), and the top-$100 \times 2$ candidates were kept in the population as the pool for the next iteration. We evaluate generated structures through metrics that assess validity, diversity, novelty, and stability. Structural validity checks three-dimensional periodicity, positive lattice volume, and valid atomic positions. Composition validity verifies positive element counts and reasonable number of elements ($\leq 10$). Structural diversity is computed by deduplicating the generated set using pymatgen's StructureMatcher algorithm, then calculating the ratio of unique structures to total generated. Composition diversity measures the fraction of distinct chemical compositions. For novelty assessment, we compare generated structures against the initial reference pool. Composition novelty identifies structures whose reduced formulas are absent from the reference set. Structural novelty is determined by grouping reference structures by formula, then for each generated structure with a matching formula, using StructureMatcher to check if it matches any reference structure with the same composition; unmatched structures are considered structurally novel. Stability evaluation uses CHGNet to relax structures and compute formation energy, then calculates energy above the convex hull ($E_\text{d}$) via a pre-computed patched phase diagram database. We report metastability rates at three thresholds: $E_\text{d} < 0.0$ eV/atom (thermodynamically stable), $E_\text{d} < 0.03$ eV/atom (highly metastable), and $E_\text{d} < 0.10$ eV/atom (M3GNet metastability criterion). The integrated SUN (Structures Unique and Novel) score combines stability and novelty: (1) filter to structures with $E_\text{d} < 0.0$ eV/atom; (2) identify unique structures within this stable subset using pymatgen's Structure.matches with scaling enabled; (3) check novelty against the reference pool; (4) compute SUN score as the number of structures simultaneously stable, unique, and novel, divided by the total number of generated structures.
